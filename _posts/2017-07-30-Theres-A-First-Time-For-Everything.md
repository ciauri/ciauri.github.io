## What do you mean "who are you"?

I'm Stephen. I thoroughly enjoy [cycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sagan), tweaking my [sourdough](http://www.tartinebakery.com) bread recipe, pretending like I'm a good [Ana](https://playoverwatch.com), and writing beautiful, functional code.

Some of my favorite moments are when other people are reading through some code like it is their first language. Those moments are even more amplified when that briefly and completely digested code was written by me. **I believe that the ability to write code in such a way that both encourages good practices and patterns, and allows others to effortlessly understand the logic and meaning behind it is a rare and invaluable skill.**

## Okay great, now what do you do?

Right now, I am an iOS Engineer at American Well. I work on the iOS Consumer SDK team. We are building a platform to allow companies to provide an effective telehealth experience within their applications. 

Building an SDK really allows me to exercise my readability skills since my deliverable is code that _shudder_ other developers will have to read, understand, and use! One may say something along the lines of "How do you get off on saying that you stress about every function, property, and model name in your application? You don't even have to build a GUI!" Well, yes. Technically that person is mostly correct. Most of the deliverable product does not contain any GUI. It does, however, comprise of entirely of a UI. **In the case of an SDK, the user is the developer and the interface is the collection of header files that they are given.**

## Well, thanks for the unsolicited preaching

Anyway, I aim to fill this space with things that I have learned and encountered as a developer. The idea is that if I encounter a topic, feature, or pattern that I like, I should write my thoughts down on paper so I can see myself learn and grow.

Thanks!
